# **AI Resume & Cover Letter Builder**

## üìÑ **Project Overview**

Welcome to the **AI Resume & Cover Letter Builder** project! This application is designed to help job seekers create professional resumes and cover letters in a matter of minutes. Powered by AI, the tool generates personalized application documents based on user input, ensuring that each document is tailored to the individual's experiences, skills, and job preferences.

This project is part of our **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course** for **Second Semester**. The goal is to apply core OOP principles in building a real-world application using Java for the backend, with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and TailwindCSS for the frontend (frontend work is pending).

## üöÄ **Installation**

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### **1. Download the Project as a ZIP File**

Click on the green **"Code"** button above and select **"Download ZIP"** to get the project files.

### **2. Install Java Development Kit (JDK)**

This project uses **Java** for the backend, so make sure you have the **JDK** installed on your system.

- Download and install the **JDK** (version 8 or higher) from the official [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
- After installation, verify your JDK setup by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
java -version
```

### **3. Install Apache Maven**

The project uses **Maven** for dependency management. If Maven is not already installed, follow these steps:

- Download **Apache Maven** from the official [Maven website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
- Install Maven and verify the installation by running the following command:

```bash
mvn -version
```

### **4. Install Tomcat**

- Download **TOmcat** from the official [Tomcat website]([https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi)).
- Install Tomcat and run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

### **5. Starting the Local Server**

This will create a `ai_resume.war` file in target folder, place that file in `tomcat\webapps\ai_resume.war`.

Then navigate to `tomcat\bin\` using `cd` and use this command in terminal to start the server on `localhost:8080`:

```bash
startup.bat
```

### **6. Run the Project**

Once the server is started, you can visit `http://localhost:8080/ai_resume/index.html` to view the AI Resume Builder.

## üìã **Usage**

Once both the backend and frontend are running:

1. Go to `http://localhost:8080/ai_resume/index.html` in your browser to access the dashboard.
2. Choose whether you'd like to generate a **Resume** or **Cover Letter**.
3. Fill out the form with your details (experience, skills, etc.).
4. Preview the generated document.
5. Download the document as a **PDF**.
