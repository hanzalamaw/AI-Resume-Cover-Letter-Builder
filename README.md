# **AI Resume & Cover Letter Builder**

## üìÑ **Project Overview**

Welcome to the **AI Resume & Cover Letter Builder** project! This application is designed to help job seekers create professional resumes and cover letters in a matter of minutes. Powered by AI, the tool generates personalized application documents based on user input, ensuring that each document is tailored to the individual's experiences, skills, and job preferences.

This project is part of our **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course** for **Second Semester**. The goal is to apply core OOP principles in building a real-world application using Java for the backend, with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and TailwindCSS for the frontend (frontend work is pending).
